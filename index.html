            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist renowned for developing the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics alongside quantum mechanics. His most famous equation, E=mc², revolutionized our understanding of energy and mass. In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which helped establish quantum theory. Beyond his scientific achievements, Einstein was a passionate advocate for peace, democracy, and social justice, speaking out against war, racism, and inequality. His work has had a profound impact on various fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and technology, making him one of the most influential scientists in history.</p>

                    <strong>Photoelectric Effect (1905)</strong>  
                    Einstein proposed that light consists of discrete energy packets (photons), explaining how light ejects electrons from metals, which led to quantum mechanics.

                    <strong>Special Relativity (1905)</strong>  
                    Introduced the famous equation **E=mc²**, showing the relationship between energy and mass, and revolutionized our understanding of space and time.

                    <strong>Brownian Motion (1905)</strong>  
                    Provided mathematical proof that tiny particles in liquid move due to molecular collisions, confirming the existence of atoms.

                    <strong>General Relativity (1915)</strong>  
                    Explained gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects, replacing Newton’s classical theory of gravitation.
